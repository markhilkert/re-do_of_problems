# Commit 1 - Research

  # Question 1: The ljust, rjust, and center functions are useful for formatting strings on a page. If you need to add any characters (e.g., spaces) to the left of your test, use rjust, if you need to add characters to the right of your text, use ljust. If you would like to center your text, you're looking for center.
  # Question 2: This prints the string '*' 8 times, concatinated as a single string.
  # Question 3: This will print an empty line, and is useful for creating whitespace.


# Commit 1 - Psuedocode

  # Write psuedocode for each method

  # input: nothing
  # output: fancy (i.e., nicely formatted) report, reporting that the yard is clean, how many eggs were found, and the coordinates (x,y) of every egg found. For good measure, be sure to include a nice note at the end to the homeowner.

  # Steps
  # 1 - Create a yard that is a 14 x 11 grid, that either stores an egg or is clean grass
  # 2 - Store the number of eggs as you go through, taking note of every (x,y) coorindate that you pick up
  # 3 - Generate a report, nicely spaced and looking great, letting the homeowner know how it went and what eggs were cleaned up.
